# DoomFirePSX
Fire effect from Doom PSX/Nintendo64

This is based on Samuel Villarreala (@SVKaiser) work who did all the reverse engineering from Doom64 assembly
to javascript .

I just cleaned things up (javascript had a few asm stigma), improved efficiency slightly and added a doom logo scrolling.
